The "Weather App" is a minimalistic and interactive web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary function is to provide users with up-to-date weather reports effortlessly. The app seamlessly integrates with a Weather API, allowing it to fetch and display accurate weather data. By default, the app seeks permission to access the user's location, presenting the current weather report for their city. Additionally, users can manually search for weather details by entering a city name.

The design philosophy is centered around simplicity and responsiveness, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. The Weather App not only offers convenience with real-time weather updates but also showcases the harmonious blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and functional web application.
